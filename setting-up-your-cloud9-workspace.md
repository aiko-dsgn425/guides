# Setting up your Cloud9 workspace

## Join GitHub

If you haven't already, sign up for a free GitHub account:

and verify your email address.

For now, think of GitHub like Dropbox-for-programmers; it's where we're going to store all of our code.

## Create GitHub organization

To keep things organized, we're going to create a separate GitHub organization account for you to store your AppDev projects under (to keep them separate from the personal projects that you'll hopefully be building soon!).

Click the `+` on the right side of the navbar and select "New organization":

Choose any name for the organization; most students choose `[YOUR USERNAME]-appdev`:

You can "Skip" or "Finish" the rest of the screens:
