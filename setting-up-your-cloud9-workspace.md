# Setting up your Cloud9 workspace

## Join GitHub

If you haven't already, sign up for a free GitHub account:

and verify your email address.

For now, think of GitHub like Dropbox-for-programmers; it's where we're going to store all of our code.

## Create GitHub organization

To keep things organized, we're going to create a separate GitHub organization account for you to store your AppDev projects under (to keep them separate from the personal projects that you'll hopefully be building soon!).

Click the `+` on the right side of the navbar and select "New organization":

Choose any name for the organization; most students choose `[YOUR USERNAME]-appdev`:

You can "Skip" or "Finish" the rest of the screens:

## Join Cloud9

I have emailed everyone invitations to join the firstdraft team on Cloud9, which is the online tool we'll be using to write and run all of our code. In your inbox, you should see something like this:

![](/assets/cloud9-invite.png)![](/assets/cloud9-username.png)

If you don't have an invitation, let me know.

Click on the link in the email and you should arrive at a welcome page. Click "Create new account":

![](/assets/cloud9-welcome.png)

Answer the next few questions:

![](/assets/cloud9-name.png)

![](/assets/cloud9-username.png)

![](/assets/cloud9-student.png)

![](/assets/cloud-captcha.png)

And you should arrive at a screen with a "Join Team" button. Click it:

![](/assets/cloud9-join-team.png)

You should wind up at your Cloud9 Dashboard. You now have everything you need to develop applications!

### Connect your GitHub account to Cloud9


Let's connect your Cloud9 account to your GitHub account to make it easy to download projects.

Click on the gear icon in the top-right:
