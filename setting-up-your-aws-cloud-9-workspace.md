# Setting up your Cloud9 workspace

## Join GitHub

If you haven't already, [sign up for a free GitHub account](https://github.com/join) \(or sign in to yours if you already have one\):

In this example screenshot, I chose a username of `demolearner1` â€” remember yours. Also, don't forget to check your email and verify the address you entered.

For now, think of GitHub like Dropbox-for-programmers; it's where we're going to store all of our code.

## Create GitHub organization

To keep things organized, we're going to create a separate GitHub organization account for you to store your AppDev projects under \(to keep them separate from the personal projects that you'll hopefully be building soon!\).

Click the `+` on the right side of the navbar and select "New organization":

Choose any name for the organization; most students choose `[YOUR USERNAME]-appdev`. In this example screenshot, I chose `demolearner1-appdev`:

You can "Skip" or "Finish" the rest of the screens:

This option doesn't require a credit card or an existing Amazon AWS account and gives you free credits for 12 months or until you graduate. 

You should then see a screen asking you to check your email to verify the address. ![](/assets/join-aws-educate-5.png)

Open up your email and click on the verification link:
