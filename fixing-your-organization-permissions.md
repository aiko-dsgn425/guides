# Fixing your organization permissions

Once upon a time, we all [created our own GitHub organizations](https://guides.firstdraft.com/setting-up-your-cloud9-workspace.html#create-github-organization) to keep our classwork separate from our personal projects.

Since then, whenever we gave permission to a third-party (like Cloud9 or grades.firstdraft.com) to access our GitHub accounts, we were supposed to remember to grant access to our organization too. **If you forgot to click "Grant" next to the organization that you created before you clicked "Authorize", you're going to run into problems.** Let's fix it.

Go to GitHub and sign in. In this example, I am signed in as the user `demolearner1`. Click on the user icon in the top-right and find "Settings":

![](/assets/github-settings.jpg)

Next, click on "Organizations" in the left sidebar:

![](/assets/github-orgs.jpg)

Find the organization that **_you_ created**. You likely picked a name like `[YOUR USERNAME]-appdev`:

![](/assets/org-list.jpg)

Next, go to the Settings of the organization:

![](/assets/find-org-settings.jpg)

In the left sidebar, find "Third-party access":

![](/assets/third-party-access.jpg)

 - If it says that you approved both, then you are good to go and you can stop reading.
 - If neither Cloud9 nor Grades appears in this list, click the "Remove restrictions" button instead and you can stop reading.
 - If it says that access is Denied next to Cloud9 or Grades, then proceed.

Click on whichever one you denied and Grant Access:

![](/assets/grant-access.jpg)

You should see a message confirming that access has been granted:

Repeat for the other third-party app if necessary and then **go back to Canvas and click on whichever assignment you want to work on again** (do not just refresh it if you already had it up).

## Resetting OAuth permissions to square one

If for some reason you need to make a single-sign-on provider (like GitHub, Twitter, or Facebook) "forget" that you ever authorized a third-party app, you need to delete or revoke the "access token" that you gave it.

In the case of GitHub, go to your personal settings:

![](/assets/github-personal-settings.jpg)

Find "Applications" in the left sidebar:

![](/assets/github-applications.jpg)

Click the "Authorized OAuth Apps" tab and then click "Revoke" next to whichever one you want to "forget":

![](/assets/github-revoke-oauth.jpg)

Then, return to the third-party app and "Sign in with..." again to start over from scratch. In our case, click on an assignment from within Canvas again to re-start the authorization process â€” and this time don't forget to grant access to the organization that **_you_ created**.
