# Tools to add to your application

 1. Exception reporting: Rollbar has a free tier (I usually configure it to create a GitHub issue when an error occurs rather than sending an email).
 1. Chat: Slack has become the norm (notify on GitHub pull requests, merges, issues).
 1. Performance monitoring: Skylight, New Relic (both have free tiers, try them both out).
 1. Email delivery: Mailgun has a free tier.
 1. Support desk: something like Intercom (I don't have a clear #1 choice as of this writing).
 1. Hound, CodeClimate
 1. CircleCI 
 1. Heroku Review Apps
