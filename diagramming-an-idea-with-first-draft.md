# Diagramming an Idea with First Draft



First, of course, you have to have some idea of what you want to build. My personal process is:

 - I like to start with some [Crazy Eights](https://library.gv.com/the-product-design-sprint-diverge-day-2-c7a5df8e7cd0) to force myself to just get some thoughts down on paper.
 
   I will usually do two or three rounds. One round, I'll use the 8 panels to progress through the different screens of a flow. Another round, I'll use the 8 panels to explore 8 different takes on the most important screen in the app.
   
   Remember, these are suppwosed to be less than 40 seconds per panel! Actually set a timer and stick to it. Try [using a sharpie rather than a pen](https://signalvnoise.com/posts/1788-oldie-but-goodie-sketching-with-a-sharpie) to prevent yourself from getting into too much detail in this phase.
   
 - Then, I select one flow that I like, and I  draw out each screen in a bit more detail. I like [Prototyping On Paper](https://marvelapp.com/pop/) to connect the sketches of each screen together, and eventually I try to "crawl" from every link and button in each screen to every other screen until I've drawn out the entire app (excluding obvious things like edit profile forms).
 
 - Next, I create a [Trello board](https://trello.com/) to list out all of the features that I've identified in my wireframe.
 
 For the time being, I create two columns in the board: "Ideas" and "First Draft".
 
 In the Ideas column, add a card for every feature that you can see in your wireframe. When I'm writing down a feature, I usually phrase it as a We now want to write down our [User Stories][7]. User stories are just features, phrased in a particular manner:

"As a **[role]**, I want to be able to **[capability]**," (and, optionally), "so that **[benefit]**."

The aim is to always be thinking from a user-centric perspective, and not from a technology or implementation perspective yet.

First, brain-dump all the features you can possibly imagine as user stories.

**Then, re-order them by priority.** A drag-and-drop interface like Trello's, or [Atom's Move Line Up/Down keyboard shortcuts](https://github.com/nwinkler/atom-keyboard-shortcuts#editing), can be handy for this.

Then, crucially, ask yourself: **what is the absolute minimum featureset I can get away with in the prototype?** The prototype's purpose is just to validate whether or not the idea is feasible and whether the core value is actually valuable. **Be ruthless in eliminating all non-essential user stories for this first draft.**

**Cross out any delayable stories to exclude them.**


 
 
 

It lets you draw your database structure in an "entity relationship diagram" (ERD), which just means we draw a box for each table and we connect the boxes with lines to represent relationships.
