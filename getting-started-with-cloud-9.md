# Getting Started with Cloud 9

You should contact me for an invitation to join Cloud 9 without requiring you to enter a credit card.

After signing up, you need to connect your GitHub account to it.

Then, to start on a project,

You'll end up in your IDE (integrated development environment), which is like having Atom, Terminal, and GitHub all within a single Chrome tab.

Run `bundle install` as shown below:

To start up your `rails server`, click the green "Run" button at the top-right of the window, and you'll have a live application running on the internet. You'll see the URL of your application in the server log in a new Terminal tab at the bottom, and you can open it up in a new Chrome tab:

Change some code just as you would in Atom, save, and refresh your app:

Whenever I say "localhost:3000", in your mind, replace that with the real live URL that you've been assigned by Cloud 9. If I say "localhost:3000/first", you instead tack "/first" on to the end of your own URL:

One last step: turn on Autosave.

Cloud 9 actually has a lot of cool features that we don't get when we work on our own computers like real-time collaboration, so you should explore! Have fun!
