# Tools to add to your application

 1. Exception reporting: Rollbar (I usually configure it to create a GitHub issue when an error occurs rather than sending an email)
 1. Chat: Slack (notify on GitHub pull requests, merges, issues)
 1. Performance monitoring: Skylight, New Relic
 1. Support desk: something like Intercom
