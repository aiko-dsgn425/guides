# Very Best Project Guide

Your primary objective is to start with [this repository](https://github.com/firstdraft-projects/very_best) and make it match [this target](http://very-best-demo-pr-3.herokuapp.com).

Here are some things to do along the way that might be helpful:

## Form a team

The primary goal of this project is to give you experience with a real software development workflow. To that end, it will be more realistic if you collaborate with others and see how that is managed.

You can form a team of up to three people; any more than that will be cumbersome for beginners to the Git-based collaboration workflow that we'll learn.

## One member of the team fork

One of the team should fork the repository to their own account. By clicking on the assignment in Canvas, it should fork automatically, just like any other homework.

## Add other members as collaborators

Under "Settings" of your fork on GitHub.com, add your other team members as collaborators.

## Set up Cloud9 workspaces as usual

All three of you should now be able to see the repository under your list on Cloud9. You should each set up your own workspace as usual.

`bin/setup`, `bin/server`, and navigate to the live app. It's the code that was generated by the Ideas tool, with some dummy data pre-populated. Click around and exercise the app, and study the generated code.

## Clone this Trello board

## Add tasks to Discussion/Ideas

Click through the target and try to identify discrete tasks required to bring your app to parity with it; e.g., "Remove extraneous links from navbar". Try to break these tasks down into pieces that are as small and bite-sized as possible.

## Populate Next Up

Once you've agreed on and fleshed out the list of tasks, move them to Next Up and sequence them.

## Read about a GitHub flow

## Get to work

Each person should take a card from Next Up and "put their face on it" (i.e. add yourself to it as a Member). Create a branch from the `/git` page in your live app, and start making commits as you work on your assigned feature.

## Open a Pull Request

When you're ready for feedback on your task, open a Pull Request and add your teammates as Reviewers.

## Back and forth

Review each others code carefully and ask questions about it and/or suggest improvements. Watch this great talk about the importance of a strong Code Review culture:

## Approve

There are a few `rails grade:all` automated tests in this project, but they don't cover every single behavior that is in the target. It's up to you each to QA one another's work and make sure it's doing the right thing(s).

## Merge

Once everyone has signed off on the feature,
