# AppDev Primer

 - Given an existing database and data, pretend you're the _application logic_ for a Twitter-like (public, asymmetrical) social network by answering these questions: [Photogram Database Exercise](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/104IDD206ubqloGZbjtSUAYwfOsFpiC6bQ3C11Re57M4/edit#gid=0)
 
    As you're answering them, think about: what's your process? If you had to explain the process for answering each question [to a five year old](https://vimeo.com/27060669), how would you do it?
 
 - [Sign up for a free GitHub account](https://github.com/join)
 
 - [Sign up for a free Heroku account](https://signup.heroku.com/) (if it asks for your preferred programming language, say Ruby)
 
 - Use those two accounts to sign up at [https://ideas.firstdraft.com/](https://ideas.firstdraft.com/)
 
 - Our first goal:
 
    Let's draw an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) together for [IMDb First Draft Target](https://appdev-primer-imdb.herokuapp.com/).
 
 - Your next goal:
 
    Explore this app: [Very Best Target](http://very-best-demo-pr-3.herokuapp.com/). It's goal is simple; it allows you to keep track of which restaurant in the city serves your favorite version of a particular dish. Your reigning champ for deep dish pizza, for example, could be [Pequod's](http://pequodspizza.com/); but you're always on the lookout for a better one.
 
    You can sign in to Very Best with usernames `alice@example.com`, `bob@example.com`, `carol@example.com`, or `eve@example.com`. All of the passwords are "`password`". Click around and familiarize yourself with the features of the application.
 
    [You can also read the features of the app here, phrased in a particular format known as **user stories**.](https://gist.github.com/raghubetina/f0e2d7d73dd996c014904b5fb24e4e61)
  
    Once you have a sense of it, your task:
 
    **Design what you think the database would have to look like in order to support the app. Draw an ERD in firstdraft.**
 
 - Finally: Draw an ERD for [Photogram First Draft Target](https://appdev-primer-photogram.herokuapp.com/users/sign_up).
